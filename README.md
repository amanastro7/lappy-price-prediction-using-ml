## SUMMARY 📝
An EMAIL SMS SPAM CLASSIFIER is a machine learning web application that is designed to identify and classify spam messages in email and SMS (short message service) communication channels. The web application uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the content and features of incoming messages and determine whether they are likely to be spam or legitimate. This can help to protect users from phishing scams, fraudulent offers, and other forms of spam that can be harmful or annoying. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of labeled spam and non-spam messages, and it can be updated and improved over time as new spam messages are encountered.



## DATASET 📁
The dataset used for this project was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged ham (legitimate) or spam.
