## SUMMARY 📝
The LAPTOP PRICE PREDICTOR is a machine learning web application that is designed predict the price of a laptop based on various specs such as processor type, memory size, storage capacity, screen resolutions, etc. The model was trained using a random forest regressor, which is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. The training data included a range of laptop prices and features, and the model was able to learn the relationships between these variables. Once trained, the model was able to make good predictions on new data, allowing users to have a better understanding of how much they should expect to pay for a laptop with certain specifications.



## DATASET 📁
The dataset used for this project was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged ham (legitimate) or spam.
